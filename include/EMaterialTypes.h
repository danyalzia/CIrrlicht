		/** The first texture is diffuse color map, the second is added

		using ADD_SIGNED, so that it is possible to add and substract
		color from the diffuse map. For example a value of
		(127,127,127) will not change the appearance of the diffuse map
		at all. Often used for terrain rendering. */

		the texture in 32 bit mode
		(video::IVideoDriver::setTextureCreationFlag()). Also, an alpha
		ref is used, which can be manipulated using

		//! Makes the material transparent based on the texture alpha channel.
		/** If the alpha channel value is greater than 127, a
		pixel is written to the target, otherwise not. This
		material does not use alpha blending and is a lot faster
		than EMT_TRANSPARENT_ALPHA_CHANNEL. It is ideal for drawing
		stuff like leafes of plants, because the borders are not
		blurry but sharp. Only first texture is used. If you are
		using this material with small textures and 3d object, it
		is a good idea to load the texture in 32 bit mode

		S3DVertexTangents (EVT_TANGENTS). You can convert any mesh into
		this format using IMeshManipulator::createMeshWithTangents()
		(See SpecialFX2 Tutorial). This shader runs on vertex shader

		hardware supports at least vertex shader 1.1 and pixel shader
		1.4. First texture is the color map, the second should be the
		normal map. The normal map texture should contain the height
		value in the alpha component. The
		IVideoDriver::makeNormalMapTexture() method writes this value
		automatically when creating normal maps from a heightmap when
		using a 32 bit texture. The height scale of the material
		(affecting the bumpiness) is being controlled by the
		SMaterial::MaterialTypeParam member. If set to zero, the
		default value (0.02f) will be applied. Otherwise the value set
		in SMaterial::MaterialTypeParam is taken. This value depends on
		with which scale the texture is mapped on the material. Too
		high or low values of MaterialTypeParam can result in strange
		artifacts. */
